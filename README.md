# SE_PROJECT_REACT

This project is a esponsive, component-based React web application built to practice modern front-end development patterns. The project simulates a social-style interface where users can view, add, and interact with items through dynamic UI updates.
The focus of the project was on mastering React fundamentals, clean project structure, reusable components, and managing application state effectively.
