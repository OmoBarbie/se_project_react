# SE_PROJECT_REACT

This project is a esponsive, component-based React web application built to practice modern front-end development patterns. The project simulates a social-style interface where users can view, add, and interact with items through dynamic UI updates.
The focus of the project was on mastering React fundamentals, clean project structure, reusable components, and managing application state effectively.

Core Functionalities
-Component-Based Architecture
Built using React with a structured, modular folder hierarchy
Implemented reusable components including App, Header, Main, Footer, ItemCard, WeatherCard, and modal components
Clean separation of concerns for scalability and maintainability

-Dynamic Rendering & State Management
Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) to manage application state
Dynamically renders content without page reloads
Ensures smooth UI updates based on user interactions

-Modal & Form Functionality
Reusable modal components for displaying item details and forms
Controlled form inputs with validation logic
Modal visibility managed through component state

-User Interaction Flow
Handles user actions such as opening modals, submitting forms, and interacting with item cards

Debugged rendering issues related to imports, component returns, and CSS visibility

-Responsive Design & Styling
Styled using BEM methodology for consistent, readable CSS
Includes normalize.css for cross-browser consistency

-Debugging & Refactoring
Resolved rendering and import issues during development
Refactored component structure to improve clarity and performance
